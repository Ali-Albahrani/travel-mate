# travel-mate

This project aims to develop an all-in-one web application to simplify and
enhance the journey planning process for public transport users in Northern
Ireland. The target audience includes daily commuters, tourists, and anyone
else relying on buses and trains to reach destinations across the region. A
key issue this project seeks to address is the current lack of a comprehensive
journey planner that helps commuters navigate Northern Ireland's public
transport system efficiently. By providing accurate schedules, real-time
service updates, and user-friendly trip planning features into one platform,
the goal is to create an invaluable resource for all public transport users.
Additional features will include personalized route suggestions to remote
nature locations, as well as an interactive map view enabling users to
monitor buses and trains in real time. With its combination of convenient
tools and real-time information, this new journey planner aims to make trip
planning smooth and straightforward for all Northern Ireland public transport
users.
